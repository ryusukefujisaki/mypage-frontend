    All the way from Palm Springs, just out of detox
    Show him a warm welcome, let's give some applause

    Greetings all, hello
    Welcome to my show
    I'm sure you'll have fun
    Watching me juggle
    Eight balls at one time
    I'm no fucking mime
    I play practical jokes
    This squirting flower
    That wasn't flour
    That blew up your nose
    It's my special blend
    Of X, coke, and K
    You should be okay
    In several hours
            </pre>

He's got over sized shoes, and ill-fitting clothes
That is real blood dripping from his fake red nose

I'm Cokie the Clown
I will trip you down
Those 12 giant steps
I brought you all presents
Against good judgment
But being a good host
You all have been dosed
The kettle cornâ€™s been laced
The fudge has been lined
You're having a great time
But you might not recall
From rohypnol
In the lemonade
Cokie homemade

He's the happiest clown
With the biggest frown
He's Cokie the Clown
